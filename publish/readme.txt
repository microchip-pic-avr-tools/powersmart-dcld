Digital Control Library Designer SDK (DCLD) for Microchip dsPIC33Â®
==================================================================
Version 0.9.11.631 Release Notes:
---------------------------------

This feature update release introduces the Code Generator version 3.0, merging code generation scripts for assembly and C-code into one generator engine. This results in a considerable code generation performance improvement for a better user experience. In addition, two more important changes requested by Beta users have been incorporated improving the filter adjustment workflow and code integration in user projects.
This release comes with a revised and extended user guide.

New Features:

1) NPNZ Controller Configuration Code Example
The Source Code View has been extended by a new tab showing a code example of the complete controller configuration code. With increasing complexity of the NPNZ16b control loop data structure it became harder for users to distinguish between which settings were enabled in the Code Configuration Option Catalog and which were irrelevant, as their related code options are disabled. 
The new code template generation allows users to either use code of only active code options (enabled in the catalog) or include all coding options, including the ones which are inactive.
This code template is not being exported like the other library files. Instead, a Copy-to-Clipboard function is provided to allow users to copy & paste the configuration code to their user project where needed.

2) Bode Plot Compare Feature
The Bode Plot toolbar got two new buttons used to store the most recent transfer function to visualize the changes over frequency when changing pole and/or zero locations. Thus, users can better compare the impact of their changes while adjusting the compensation filter settings. By clicking the Save button on the upper right of the Bode Plot view, the most recent transfer function is stored and shown as dimmed shadow. When users then change pole and/or zero locations the new transfer function is overlaid with the stored graph. The Clear button deletes the stored transfer function.

Optimizations:

1) Code Generator Engine v3.0
Previous versions of DCLD used two independent code generators, one for generating Assembly code, the second for all C-code files. With the introduction of the code generator v3.0 files of both languages are now generated by the same engine and being defined in one, unified script. Although this is mostly relevant for the internal management of the tool and related testing procedures, users will experience a significantly increased performance of the code generation being more than four times faster while producing more accurate and detailed debugging messages.

2) NPNZ16b Control Block Diagram
The block diagram in the Block Diagram view has been updated to show a more detailed description of the NPNZ16b controller and its options. 

Bugfixes:

1) Alternate Source
Rating: Critical
A conflict in option assignments caused the control input source to remain active when switched to the alternate source by using the swap_source control bit in the NPNZ16b status word.

2) Alternate Target Anti-Windup
Rating: Critical
A conflict in option assignments caused the control output clamping values of an alternate control target to be ignored. As a result, the clamping values of the primary control output target were also applied to the alternate control output target.

Change Notes - Impact on Existing Projects:

1)  API Changes
In this release version the API did not change, and existing user code will not be affected.

2)  Execution of Generated Code / Timing
(none)

A BIG Thank You to all Beta users who spent all the time and efforts digging into features and issues helping to make this tool better and better!
We deeply appreciate your support!
